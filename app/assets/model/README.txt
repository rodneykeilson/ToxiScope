Copy Commulyzer baseline JSON artifacts into this folder before building the app.
Placeholder JSON files are committed here so the TypeScript build succeeds; replace every file (metadata, vocabulary, coefficients, intercepts, thresholds, labels) with the exported bundle from artifacts/baseline/json/ before running the app for real predictions.
