## Common Failure Patterns

### False Negative Patterns (Missed Toxicity)
1. **Sarcasm and Irony**: Model struggles with sarcastic toxic comments
2. **Gaming-specific Insults**: Subtle gaming slang not recognized
3. **Implicit Threats**: Indirect threatening language missed
4. **Code-switching**: Mixed language patterns confuse the model

### False Positive Patterns (Over-Detection)
1. **Quoted Content**: Discussing toxic content triggers detection
2. **Gaming Terminology**: Competitive gaming terms mistaken for insults
3. **Neutral Profanity**: Non-hostile use of profane words
4. **Context-dependent**: Phrases that need context to interpret

## Recommendations

1. **Data Augmentation**: Add more sarcasm/irony examples
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust thresholds per-label for balance
3. **Context Window**: Consider longer context for ambiguous cases
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tune on more gaming-specific data
